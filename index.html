		<p align="center"> Number 15: Burger King foot lettuce.
The last thing you'd want in your Burger King Burger is someone's foot fungus. But as it turns out, that might be what you get.
A 4channer uploaded a photo anonymously to the site showcasing his feet in a plastic bin of lettuce with the statement 'This is the lettuce you eat at Burger King.'
Admittedly, he had shoes on. But that's even worse. </p>

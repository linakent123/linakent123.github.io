<h1>Intro</h1>


<p> You might be wondering, "Golly gee! What could Nine Inch Nails possibly be?!?!?!?!" Well, let me tell you all about 'em. <br>
    NIN was formed by Trent Reznor in 1988, who remained the only member of the band until 2016, when Atticus Ross officially joined. <br>
    NIN belongs to the industrial rock genre, although their music sometimes leans more to the metal side. <br>
    They are very cool and awesome, as shown by the fact that they have sold over 20 million records worldwide (thank you Wikipedia!) <br>

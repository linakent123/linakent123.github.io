<h1>Fun Facts</h1>


<p> - The band covered themselves in mud for their 1994 Woodstock performance <br>
    - Pretty Hate Machine, The Downward Spiral, and Broken are their best albums and you can't tell me otherwise <br>
    - The video for Down In It was misinterpreted by the FBI as a snuff film depicting an actual death and it took them a whole year to figure out it was just Trent Reznor <br>
    - Trent dyes his hair black every 2 weeks, his natural hair color is brown
